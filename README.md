## About
I developed this research project in a team of 3. This project can only be run using the Oculus Rift, since we did not have access to the HTC Vive at the time. The player is tested on their concepts of combination and permutation by going through a simulation of an escape room environment. They will have to utilize combinations and permutations to solve puzzles to get to the next stage. The project was presented to CPP's 13th Annual Science Research Symposium. The gameplay for this project can be found here: 

## Contribution
I was responsible mainly for the second and last stage of the project. I wrote the scripts used for the functionality of solving the second room which includes reseting the cubes, checking for the correct combination of cubes, and the controller inputs. I also am responsible for adding in all the music and sound effects used for the project.

## Thoughts
This was my first project I developed in Unity and I couldn't have been happier. I learned a lot about what I can create and how to incoporporate that into Virtual Reality. If I had more time to work on it, I would add more rooms that the player can solve, and fix some small errors that managed their way through.
